# Redis_Project
I created library databases in Redis and library application in JavaScript. In my projected I used:
* Preparation of meaningful, consistent data.
* Datatypes as: string, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes.
* two scripts in Lua

In application I created: 
* single data readout, reading the whole array of values - lists, sets
* using a parameter in the url
* a form allowing for adding / updating / deleting data in the database with the use of using the GET method
* batch function
